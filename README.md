# Update DNS
##### A small ruby script to update a dyndns service with your current ip if changed.
just adjust your update.rb with your credentials and run it `ruby update.rb` 
One could run that on start up or via cronjob or whatever.  
(This is actually only useful in case your lovely and old o2 router does not support your dyndns service.
